" File: multiple_cursors.vim
" Author: Terry Ma
" Description: Emulate Sublime Text's multi selection feature 
" Issues:
" - Performance in terminal vim degrades significantly with more cursors
" - All user input typed before Vim is able to fan out the last operation to all
"   cursors is lost. This is a implementation decision to keep the input
"   perfectly synced in all locations, at the cost of potentially losing user
"   input.
" - Multi key commands is not supported
" - Single key commands that do not terminate properly cause unexpected
"   behavior. For example, if the cursor is on the first character in the buffer
"   and 'b' is pressed.
" - Undo behavior is unpredictable
" - Select mode is not implemented
" - There is a bug with selection and highlight when wrap is on
"
" Potential Features:
" - Create a blinking cursor effect? Good place to do it would be instead of
"   waiting for user input, cycle through the highlight
" - Integrate with the status line? Maybe show a special multicursor mode?
" - Support mouse? Ctrl/Cmd click to set cursor?
"
" Features:
" - Real time update of cursor locations
" - In normal mode, pressing <C-n> will highlight the current word under cursor,
"   and places a 'multicursor' at the end of the word, and goes to visual mode
" - In visual mode, right after the above operation, pressing <C-n> again will
"   search for the word forward, and places a new cursor at the end of the
"   resulting search, one can continue to do this in Visual mode, this resembles
"   the Cmd-D feature of Sublime
" - In insert mode, insert operations are captures and replayed at all the
"   cursor locations
" - Pressing <Esc> in Normal mode quits multicursor mode and clears all cursors
" - Normal mode single keystroke commands work:
"   - Works: 'w,e,i,p,a,h,j,k,l,x,v,b'
"   - Does not work: ''
" - Replace mode just seems to work
" - Visual mode
"   - Works: 'w,e,b,h,j,k,l,o'
"   - Does not work: 'A, I', because <C-o> does not get it out of normal mode
"   for these commands. It takes two
